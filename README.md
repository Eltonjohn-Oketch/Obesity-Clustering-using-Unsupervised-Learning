# Obesity-Clustering-using-Unsupervised-Learning
# Introduction

This project will levearage various unsupervised methods of machine learning towards estimating people prone to or with Obesity through various ways of clustering and try to quantify the hidden patterns in the unlabelled data.

# Project Overview(Description)

Obesity and being overweight together make up one of the leading preventable causes of death in the world, and especially high income countries. Obesity is a major health problem strongly associated with many chronic illnesses with negative effects and long-term consequences, not only for the patients but also their families. Being overweight means that a person has extra body weight while obesity means having a high amount of extra body fat. Being overweight or obese raises the risk for health problems. These include coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, asthma, high cholesterol, osteoarthritis, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, and certain types of cancer

# Recording the Experimental Design

To identify the levels of obesity based on the factors of eating and physical condition provided in the dataset.
To find the value of BMI for each person.
To investigate the age ranges where the types of obesity are more common and the reason.
To ascertain the gender more at risk of obesity and investigate the lifestyle choices that contribute to this.
